### Features:

- ES6 Support via [babel](https://babeljs.io/) (v7)
- JavaScript Linting via [eslint-loader](https://github.com/MoOx/eslint-loader)
- SASS Support via [sass-loader](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader)
- Autoprefixing of browserspecific CSS rules via [postcss](https://postcss.org/) and [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)

When you run `npm run build` we use the [mini-css-extract-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin) to move the css to a separate file. The css file gets included in the head of the `index.html`.
